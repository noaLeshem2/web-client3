# In-Chat Project based on Server communication by Inbal & Noa
Meet our chat for contact and share data.
## The required installations-
* npm
* node.js
* react-router-dom
* @microsoft/signalr
## What our chat do?
We created chat, which support sharing text messages by using server.
### How should i use the chat?
The first page that appears is the login page. You can enter through
by logging in with one of the server's users provided below
(for example, we recommend using the following user - username = inba33, password = 123).
A second way to enter is by registering, which is linked to on the login page.
### What happend when i enter?
When you enter the chat, all the conversations with other users will appear.
Of course if you registered then you will not see any existing conversations.
You can click on any possible user and contact with him.
You also can add new conversation with one of the existing users. 
## usernames and their passwords :
username = inba33, password = 123. <br/> 
username = tomer50, password = 123. <br/>
username = noale10, password = 123. <br/>
username = yoval99, password = 123. <br/>
username = harel21, password = 123. <br/>
username = yair39, password = 123. <br/>
username = michal321, password = 123. <br/>
*to see the chat we created in hard-coded, use one of the usernames and passowrds above.*
## How to run the project?
We have to run the server first, run this server repositorie - https://github.com/inbalapt/ServerApp.git - run the ServerApi folder.
After the server is runing, run the following command -
```bash
npm start
```
then the chat is running.
